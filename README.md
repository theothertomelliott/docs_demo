# Open Source Documentation Demo

This is a companion project to a talk on building documentation for open source projects using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and testing it with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).

# Branches

The master branch represents the project prior to documentation. The example branch follows
each step in the process of setting up documentation for a project.

# find.go

find.go is an example application that will search in the current directory for files with names matching
a specified pattern.

It is this application that will be documented.
